                   Hello! 
                   <br>
                   I guess that you are curious what this game is all about? I will get you a short introduction how to play this challenging game. 
                   Have you ever heard of Simon Game? If not then you can click this link to get a better understanding of how Eriks game works, 
                   because it is almost similar. But this game has a slightly different game interface and offers you as a player to choose from 
                   three different game modes, 
                   <br>
                   Easy | Medium | Hard. 
                   <br>
                   Choose wisely and have fun! Best of luck.
